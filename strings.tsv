DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Goodness!
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Ah!
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Oh my!
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_1_INPUT	What a relief to see that my calling worked... I was almost certain your soul would've been lost.
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_INPUT	I am Angela Flux, Mystic Guardian of Sanctum.
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_3_INPUT	I understand that you may have a few questions to ask...
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_4_INPUT	But first, let's get your bearings sorted out, yes?
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_4_SELECTION_0	See ya!
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_QUEST_ACCEPT_RESPONSE_0	Ah, yes... This is certainly a task in need of focus.
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_QUEST_ACCEPT_RESPONSE_1	Please be careful... The world outside is unpredictable.
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_QUEST_ACCEPT_RESPONSE_2	I pray for your success, adventurer...
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_QUEST_ACCEPT_RESPONSE_3	Come back safely...
DIALOGDATA_ANGELA_QUEST_COMPLETE_RESPONSE_0	Good work... There is a lot more ahead of us.

DIALOGDATA_ENOK_NAME_TAG	Enok
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	State your business, quickly.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	There is much work to do.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Speak.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Nevermind.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_1	I would like to know...
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_2	Got Quests?
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Yes?
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	I have an answer.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	No question is left unanswered.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Let's hear it.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Actually...
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_1	Who are you?
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_2	What is a Fighter?
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_3	Parrying?
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_INPUT	I am Enok, the Fighter Guardian. I am the ferocity of the light, upbringer of hell against darkness.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_1_INPUT	I take it you are new to this world. You've arrived late, during a time where it stands corrupted.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_2_INPUT	My powers provide the strength and vitality to the souls who are driven to prove themselves worthy.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_3_INPUT	I sense a spark of determination within you. Succumb to fear, and you will fail.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_3_SELECTION_0	Goodbye.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_3_SELECTION_1	Another thing...
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_0_INPUT	A lost soul can be driven to the ferocity of a Fighter once they have proven to be strong enough.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_1_INPUT	A Fighter can rend the flesh of foes, weakening them with bloodshed.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_2_INPUT	A Fighter can devastate surrounding enemies, from a close stomp, or afar with a lethal strike.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_3_INPUT	It takes supreme focus to have what it takes to master the art of combat.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_4_INPUT	If you have what it takes, return to me, and I can teach you.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_4_SELECTION_0	Goodbye.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_4_SELECTION_1	I see, anyways...
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	There is business that must be tended to.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Let's see if you're up to the task.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Today is a fine day for bloodshed.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	It's time to gather your strength.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	See ya!
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_1	Something else...
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Parrying your foes is essential in melee combat.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_1_INPUT	To parry them, block shortly before they initiate their attack.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_2_INPUT	If you successfully parry them, it will not cost any of your stamina.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_3_INPUT	However, your foes must be relatively as strong as you for this to take in effect.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_4_INPUT	If you were to fight your foe and they happen to be much stronger than you,
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_5_INPUT	you will falter and loose your stamina quickly.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_6_INPUT	Watch your enemies closely. They are nothing to you if you strategize.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_6_SELECTION_0	See ya!
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_6_SELECTION_1	Something else...
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Looks like we have fresh blood.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_1_INPUT	If you seek to toughen yourself and find the ways of valor, speak to me.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_INPUT	If you have anything to say, it is best you do so now.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_SELECTION_0	Nevermind.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_SELECTION_1	I would like to know...
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_SELECTION_2	Got Quests?
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_QUEST_ACCEPT_RESPONSE_0	Granted.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_QUEST_ACCEPT_RESPONSE_1	Let the bloodshed commence.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_QUEST_ACCEPT_RESPONSE_2	The time is now.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_QUEST_COMPLETE_RESPONSE_0	You're becoming more capable of these tasks, lost one.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_QUEST_COMPLETE_RESPONSE_1	Well done, lost one.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_QUEST_COMPLETE_RESPONSE_2	The hunt is complete.
DIALOGDATA_ENOK_QUEST_COMPLETE_RESPONSE_3	Well played.

DIALOGDATA_SALLY_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_2_INPUT	Y'know, Spike can hold onto your items if you're overburdened. Ain't that something?

DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Are you ready to take on a new look?
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Goodbye.

DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Let us commence.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Goodbye.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Illusion Stones are the main source of my power, or rather, my service.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_1_INPUT	While not necessarily a currency, they are considered as a Trade Item.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_2_INPUT	Illusion Stones can be purchased for a high value, or be found from the outside world.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_3_INPUT	Each category you change your appearance in (Color, Head, Body), will cost one Illusion Stone each.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_3_SELECTION_0	I see, anyways...
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_0_INPUT	My services are not needed to apply vanity to your gear.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_1_INPUT	However, you will need Illusion Stones to do this task.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_2_INPUT	Seek your inventory menu, and press the vanity button on the top right corner of the Tab Menu to access your vanity slots.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_3_INPUT	All but weapons and rings can be vanitized.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_4_INPUT	The equipment slot you wish to vanitize must have something equipped to override the look.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_5_INPUT	You will not be able to transmogrify equipment that is higher level than you, so keep that in mind.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_6_INPUT	I take it you have many ideas with this new found knowledge, yes?
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Greetings. I take it you may have some interest in me?
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_1_INPUT	I am the Mirror of Illusion, Angela's construct. My voice can only be heard between myself and the one who chooses to speak to me.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_INPUT	Bring me Illusion Stones, and I can change your look permanently. Though, keep in mind that you cannot be in the form of another race.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_SELECTION_0	Goodbye.
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_SELECTION_1	Illusion Stones?
DIALOGDATA_VANITYMIRROR_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_SELECTION_2	Equipment Vanity?

DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Hey! Don't startle me like that. Geeze.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Nevermind.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_1	About something...
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_2	Enchant my stuff!
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Alright, hope you got the funds.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	My services aren't cheap, so think hard.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Hm? Oh right, we can do that.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	This better be something new for me to enchant...
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_4	Oookay, let's do it.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_1_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Seeya!
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Uhm, yeah?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	No stupid questions, please...
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Is it about enchanting?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Okay, I'm listening.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Nevermind.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_1	You're cute!
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_2	Apprentice?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_3	Enchanting?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_2_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_4	Weapon Scaling?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Okay, so this is how enchanting works.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_1_INPUT	You give me a piece of equipment. Weapons or armor can do.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_2_INPUT	Depending on the equipment, it'll cost crowns. Rare items will additionally need trade items to enchant.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_3_INPUT	Make sure the equipment isn't formally exotic though, I can't enchant those.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_4_INPUT	Enchanting is a delicate process, and it's nearly impossible to choose which one you want.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_5_INPUT	Because of that, you will get a random enchantment each time.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_6_INPUT	I hope you understood all that. I would rather not give you the run-down again.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_6_SELECTION_0	Thanks, seeya!
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_3_DIALOG_6_SELECTION_1	I'll enchant something.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Ugh, shut up...
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Yeah, that's not a question.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	You sure about that? You might not be saying that after I kick your face in.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	You know, some things are just better off being unsaid.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_4_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_4	Keep it to yourself, buddy.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Yep, I'm Angela's apprentice. A Mystic, part of her studies.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_1_INPUT	I've branched off to study more on enchanting rather than studying offensive magic.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_2_INPUT	I think it's more chill. It makes good cash too, when things go well anyways.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_5_DIALOG_3_INPUT	I respect Angela. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here. You should respect her too.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Right. So, if you put an equippable weapon into the enchanting slot, you can change the damage scale of it.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_1_INPUT	Depending on what you wanna do, you're gonna need some stones to do this sort of thing.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_2_INPUT	For Strength, you'll need Might Stones.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_3_INPUT	Dexterity will need Agility Stones.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_4_INPUT	Lastly, Mind requires Flux Stones. Got it? Anyways...
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_5_INPUT	If the weapon is inherited to the scale you want, then it won't cost any stones. Cool, right?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_6_INPUT	The stones can be found around the world, but they can also be sold from vendors too.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_BRANCH_6_DIALOG_7_INPUT	The stones are pricy, so I won't cheap out on you and add more to the cost. So... you're welcome.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT	Hm? Oh hey. What's up?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_1_INPUT	I'm Vivian, Angela's apprentice.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_2_INPUT	My specality is enchanting weapons and armor.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_3_INPUT	If you got some cash, I can probably help you out. Just ask nicely.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_4_INPUT	Sooo... what's it gonna be? You interested in my services?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_4_SELECTION_0	Maybe later.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_4_SELECTION_1	You bet!
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_SHOPKEEP_RESPONSE_0	How many times are we gonna do this now?
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_SHOPKEEP_RESPONSE_1	You get what you get.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_SHOPKEEP_RESPONSE_2	That doesn't look that bad, I guess.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_SHOPKEEP_RESPONSE_3	Roll of the dice, as they say.
DIALOGDATA_VIVIAN_SHOPKEEP_RESPONSE_4	Hm, didn't think it'd come out this way.
DIALOGDATA_DUNGEONPORTAL_NAME_TAG	
DIALOGDATA_DUNGEONPORTAL_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT	What is your destiny?
DIALOGDATA_DUNGEONPORTAL_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_SELECTION_0	Cancel
DIALOGDATA_DUNGEONPORTAL_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_0_INPUT	The portal eminates an evil power! It's unlike any other portal you've seen before.
DIALOGDATA_DUNGEONPORTAL_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_1_INPUT	What is your destiny?
DIALOGDATA_DUNGEONPORTAL_INTRODUCTION_BRANCH_0_DIALOG_1_SELECTION_0	Cancel

DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Strength defeats the weak! It's a known fact that Fighters have the upper hand.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Have you witnessed the strategy of Cyclone? It's my life long goal to learn it myself!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Enok is the guardian I worship. His determination and valor resonates with me.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	I hope to see the world safe again. It doesn't seem like that'll happen.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Do you think the Sky Whale still watches us?
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	I've witnessed the Shattering. I used to live in the Effold Terrace.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Sigh...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Did you know you can breathe underwater? It's a blessing from Angela.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	This water is so pure. We're so fortunate to have it.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	This is the Sanctum Lake. We tend to relax here when times are rough.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Hm... I wonder what water spells are out there.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Angela's writing is so divine!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	I've been practicing Fluxbolt. I can only get it to hit a couple times...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	The sound of arcane magic brings me joy.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Imbue is a very powerful spell. It can make your melee weapons magical!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	I'm sorry, I'm quite busy.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	No time to chat, I'm trying to study something.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Hm... oh? Sorry, I can't talk right now.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Greetings. I see you have come to this world in peace.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	My colleague thinks you look cute.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	There's such little time to learn.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_05__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_05__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Hail, lost soul. Does this place entice you?
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_05__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	This Tower brings me solitude.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU_05__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	My colleague seems to like you.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	These two don't know what it takes to be truly agile. If only they knew...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Nothing beats the power of wit and speed. Fighters and Mystics don't stand a chance against Bandits.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Have you spoken to Sally? She's remarkable.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	It is quite clear that the way of the Mystic is far more superior than the others.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Spellcasting is the better option, there are no exceptions!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Angela knows best, and she's the one that knows more than the others.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	I have quite a lot of things to study soon...

DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_08__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Heya, welcome to the Barracks!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_08__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	You've met Enok, correct? He is the Fighter Guardian.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_08__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	My strength communes with Enok's powers.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Hi there!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	I see you're not from this world. We're natives here. Lost souls are always welcome.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_02__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	As long as you assist us in this dire time, you're free to rest here!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_07__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_07__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Welcome to the Barracks, adventurer.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_07__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Master Enok knows of your presence. Don't disappoint him.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_07__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	If only I could kill some slimes right now...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	It's dangerous out there. I'd advise you to be prepared.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	In case if you don't know, the portal to the outer sanctum opens when you have spoken to Angela.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	If only the outside world was safe like it once was...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	We try to keep Sanctum stocked with all the essentials.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	How many bunbags do we have left? I lost count...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Hmm... I should talk to Sally just to make sure we have everything...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Agh, we seem to be low on carrot cake. I love that stuff!

DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Hiya, traveller!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	I've got some training to do, I wanna beat up some slimes!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	We're not strong enough to take on the world outside, but I wanna prove that wrong someday.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	Between you and me, I can't wait to kick this guys ass!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_03__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_4	What? You've lived in a world that isn't always overcast?
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Hail, adventurer. This is the gateway to the Outer Sanctum.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	I'm stationed here to guard Sanctum in case anything comes through.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_06__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Hm... how many chances have you had to prove yourself beyond this world?
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	I do wonder what other place out there in this world is as safe as here...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Have you been to the Crescent Keep? Rumor has it that it was once a temple of nature magic.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	The Guardians seem to have predated our existance, but i've been told this isn't true.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_SANCTUM__CLIENTNPCS__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN_01__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	I wonder what's for dinner...
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	It's too lovely here for me to leave. I'll be staying here.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	Did you open the portal leading here?
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_BLU__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Blessed day, Angela has not forgotten us!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Oh? I thought i'd never see anyone new here.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_1	It seems the portal is opened here now... thank goodness!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_2	Please rest here before going back out, and be careful!
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_RED_04__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_3	How is Sanctum? I hope things are okay there.
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT	
DIALOGDATA_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_00_LOCAL_BRANCH_MAP_HUB_WALLOFTHESTARS__LOCALNPC__NPC_SANCTUMCIVILIAN_GRN__DIALOGTRIGGER_DIALOG_0_INPUT_ALT_0	Some say the Wall of the Stars can speak within your mind.
